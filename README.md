# StarsLivelyWallpaper
A resizable wallpaper imitating the original Windows XP screensaver.

Done in VisualStudio using p5.js for use in Lively Wallpaper as an animated background.
An added feature is adjusting the scrolling speed by simply moving the mouse closer or
farther from the center of the window.

This was done only for fun / as a hobby.

Note: JavaScript is not truly my business, but 'tis pretty.
